    "# Nicolas' Mid-Bootcamp Project | A Gastro-Scene Showdown!\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHICH CITY WILL BE CROWNED GOURMET-CAPITAL OF EUROPE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 10 exciting cities competing for this most glamorous title! As for our contender selection, I oriented myself by the (European) countries (and cities) of residence of my fellow Ironhack students and from there selected one city (except for Germany) that is sure to offer exciting culinary delights:\n",
    "- Dusseldorf, Germany - my city of residence with some fantastic dining options, especially Asian food. But how will it stack up against these major contenders? I promise no bias on my part, just stone-cold data wrangling!\n",
    "- Amsterdam, Netherlands - some fantastic (international) eateries here, home of the NL Ironhack remote campus. Thankfully the Dutch West India Company imported more than just goods!\n",
    "- Barcelona, Spain - Madrid would also be a fantastic choice for restaurants, tough call but Barceló is just a special kind of cool!\n",
    "- Berlin, Germany - bringing in a 2nd German contender against this overbearing cosmopolitan competition, chosen because several from my cohort live here, but also as it has what is probably Germany's most experimental restaurant scene.\n",
    "- Istambul, Turkey - a major metropol straddling Europe and Asia, a fusion of east and west! We can expect an exciting culinary scene.\n",
    "- Lisbon, Portugal - the cultural and political heart of Portugal, would expect nothing short of fantastic here! \n",
    "- London, UK - London breaks conventions, not just with the image of British food in general. A real dine-out heavyweight champ!\n",
    "- Milan, Italy - no dining competition complete without some Italian flair. Chosen over Rome for it's fashion fame and economical strength - recipe for a stellar restaurant scene. Carpe Diem!\n",
    "- Paris, France - what pan-european food competition would be complete without some 'joie de vivre'? \n",
    "- Zurich, Switzerland - no fellow students from here, chosen for my love of Switzerland and Zurich. Honestly cannot remember ever having had a disappointing meal anywhere in CH. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions we seek to answer with the research that follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which competing city will win the title 'Gourmet Capital of Europe'?\n",
    "2. What is the probability of having a positive dining experience by randomly selecting any restaurant in our contestant cities?\n",
    "3. Which restaurants are the best in each city?\n",
    "4. City Restaurant Heatmaps - Where am I most likely to find a good restaurant? Are there any clusters?\n",
    "5. \"Ceap&Cheerful-Meter\" (TM) - Which restaurants offer a good bang for your buck?\n",
    "\n",
    "**INTRODUCTORY NOTE ON DATA METHODOLOGY:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I had attempted to code a webcrawler to parse Google Maps and scrape restaurant information using Python, but ran into several issues that I was unable to resolve by myself. Instead, I used outscraper.com, an online scraping tool to do the job for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so unfortunately limited my sample size to 500 restaurants/rows per city as that was the maximum free query size allowed by the tool. A smaller city target like Dusseldorf or Zurich may or may not actually have around that many restaurants, but major cities like Berlin, Paris or London would likely have far more. Additionally, I had little control over the logic applied by the tool (or rather Google Maps) in giving me my 500 'restaurant' search results per city - though I assume Google would use it's considerable AI clout to deliver results of the most searched/selected/popular restaurants in any given location in descending order. Yet, not all values in each dataset may actually be fully-fledged restaurants - some may be cafés, bakeries or delicacy shops (Et al.) that sell meals, and even some (*shudders*) fast-food franchises. \n",

    "I expected to see a few NaN values, especially in **reviews** - we have about 300 restaurants accross all cities with no reviews. To decide how to treat these 300 rows I checked the value counts of nan values in rating contrasted by city. As a result I saw that it is fairly balanced, with Amsterdam having the largest count of unrated establishments at 54, and Lisbon having the least at 11. Given that this won't cause a severe imbalance in my dataset I decided to drop these rows. Other options I considered as an alternative but waved aside:\n",

    "Very concerning to see 113 rows of restaurants without an address, city or country. Exploring some of these locales further, I see that we are mostly dealing with food trucks, or delivery-only businesses that have no seating options. We can turn NaN values for address to 'no address' but will have to somehow substiute NaN values for city and country to allocate these businesses to the actual city they are based in.\n",

To remove these outliers and errors and make it purely a competition of the 10 actual cities, I went back to my cleaning function and made sure that all values for the column 'city' e.g. for the Lisbon df are overriden by 'Lisbon' only.\n"

    "## Closing Remarks\n",
    "**Final revision from Sunday, Oct. 1 2022**\n",
    "\n",
    "This excercise has been quite fun for me overall! Though I must report some serious disappointments thrown my way:\n",
    "1. That my data did not really necessitate the use of modeling was both a relief but also quite upsetting. On the one hand, I was seriously scrambled to get the above together in time without having to delve into modeling; but on the other I feel like I was deprived of a valuable learing and practice opportunity...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The proportionally large amount of non-restaurant related businesses was a serious bummer, especially because I discovered it way too late and did not take more time to check my data thoroughly at the onset. Getting the data of GMaps just took a looong time and I started way too late and felt I had to forge ahead. In the end, this cost me more time than if I had just done it right and approached the data with more caution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Additionally, visualising the restaurants overlaid on city maps revealed further inconsistencies in the data:\n",
    "    - Some restaurants where far outside the city limits for some (not all) of these cities - especially for Paris, Amsterdam and Dusseldorf, one from Paris even appeared in the USA. In the visualisation I was able to filter those out using Tableau. \n",
    "    - There were noticeable 'gaps' for each city for which my data did not list any restaurants. Most neighbourhoods in any city would have at least one, if not more restaurant or takeout businesses, so while I did expect 'clustering' around popular going-out areas for each city, I did not expect to see a lot of empty streches of map, or Istanbul, where there is mostly clustering inside the East and West parts of the city, but none inbetween... It is also quite apparent on cities like A'dam, where there are fewer restaurants in the circles around Central Station than I would come to expect. Additionally, my neighbourood in Dusseldorf was missing what is probably one of the better Italian restaurants in the city. \n",
    "    - The above points all harken back to my method of data collection. I chalk this up not only to the webscraping tool I used to get my data, but also Google's algorythm that returned results in nearby Cologne when looking for Dus restaurants. I wonder if things would have been different if I had figured out how to scrape GMaps on my own without the tool and potentially collect larger and more complete datasets for each city - 500, especially in larger areas like Paris or London is simply not enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The entire process was very long-winded and full of distractions - especially my failed attempts in data scraping and needing to ask my classmates to help me get the data from outscraper.com's free test. I feel like having learned some valuable lessons and being much further than when I started this course, but at the same time I still feel to be at the start of a very long road ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I spend way too many hours working late into the night this week. I had a serious sleep deficiency...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. I was not fully satisfied with my calculations to obtain answers to my questions 1) **Which competing city will win the title 'Gourmet Capital of Europe'?** and 3) **Which restaurants are the best in each city?**.\n",
    "    1. For \"Which competing city will win the title 'Gourmet Capital of Europe'?\" I used a simple weighted average, which I believe works quite well, but does give extra weight to restaurants and cities where there are more (positive) restaurant reviews - which would always favour Lissabon, as it simply had the most often reviewed restaurants of the 10 contestants. This extra weight does not matter much, as I believe google restaurant reviews are highly subjective in nature and people most likely will vote at extremes, i.e. 1 or 5, but by democratic principle, the more of these reviews we have, the more clear an image will we have of the actual experience for the reviewed business, hence some weight should be given to a 4,3 restaurant with 18,000 reviews vs. a 4,6 restaurant with only 6,000 reviews. However, this also means that we are probably underweighing a lot of restaurants that are either: \n",
    "        - secret pearls: i.e. places that are mostly fantastic, but few people know and talk about\n",
    "        - new entrants: i.e. places that have recently opened and could not garner many reviews\n",
    "        - expensive/exclusive: i.e. places that less people end up reviewing as fewer may eat there due to high costs, or exclusivity (like Michelin-Starred restaurants with long reservation waitlists). \n",
    "    2. Equally, for \"Which restaurants are the best in each city?\" I had to resort to using a groupby and then filter restaurants by highest number of reviews and secondly their review score. As stated in point A above, this is the best way to interpret this data given the subjective nature, but it yielded 'funny' results: Hard Rock Cafe coming in 1st for both Berlin and Amsterdam (and again 4th for London) as they had they simply had way more positive reviews than anyone else. Had I had more time, I would have liked to fiddle around further with calculating a Bayesian average for this as it might have changed things somehow, or find a different way to calculate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**FINAL NOTE:** A more complete dataset would likely have made a different outcome in my results. Again, quite a few restaurants appear to have been missing at the more suburban level in all cities, and there a lot of outliers, which in this case refers to businesses that could not be considered restaurants (electronics manufacturers, accounting firms... but also supermarkets), as well as a few restaurants that were outliers in the sense that they were not actually located in the city I meant to analse. Actually, cutting the non-restaurant related businesses from the dataset did not change the rating and ranking of both Lissabon and Milan (both respectively remained in first and last place in both cases) but it did shuffle the inbetween rankings of Amsterdam, London and Zurich.
